# Crafting Interpreters
A book written by Robert Nystrom, visit the website here: http://craftinginterpreters.com

This repository stores my implementation of the Lox language, written as I follow along with the book.
The book contains two implementations of the Lox language, one in Java (jlox) which is this repo.
The other implementation is a bytecode interpreter written in C and takes up the second half of the book.
